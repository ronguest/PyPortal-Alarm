PyPortal Alarm Clock
========

An alarm clock based on the PyPortal from Adafruit. This reads the alarm time from a file on a server so that the time can be set remotely. It is hard coded to skip playing the alarm on the weekends and also if the alarm time has been set "0000". The alarm sound is played in the background and it supports long audio files (limited only by the storage on the PyPortal or the attached SD card, in WAV format, 16 bit 22Khz). To silence the alarm simply touch the screen.
